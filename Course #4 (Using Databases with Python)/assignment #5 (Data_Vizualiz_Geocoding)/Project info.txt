The assignment: start with "where.data", which stores the names of places (such as Northeastern University, University of London, etc) and then load it into"geoload.py" 
to use google to look up the addresses of those places and obtain data about them, and then store those in the database "geodata.sqlite". Then " geodump.py" reads that 
database and produces "where.js" which allows the user to open "where.html" to see a visualization of those places in a google map. I added the place "University College
in London" to "where.data" and then ran geoload.py and geodump.py and then opened where.html to see its location on the map. 
This project was done in Python2.7.
